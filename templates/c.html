         <h2>How does RentMe protect my account?</h2>
  Preventing fraud and unauthorized logins
Our security teams build and maintain multiple detection systems dedicated to monitoring accounts
    for suspicious activity such as unauthorized logins or financial fraud.<p></p>
    For example, your RentMe account is linked to both your phone number and your mobile device to make sure only you can access your account.
    If you see unexpected activity or suspect your account was compromised, please let us know.<p></p>
    Protecting passwords<br>
     Your RentMe Money password is protected on our servers using strong cryptography methods.
    This makes your password unreadable or unusable by anyone who might try to steal it.<p></p>
    Securing transaction information<br>
For added security, weâ€™ll ask you to provide your password before viewing your RentMe Money transactions.
    This extra step helps protect your sensitive information from unauthorized access.
    <h2>What can I do to protect my account?</h2>
Turn on two-step verification<br>
When 2-step verification is on,
    you must enter a code along with your password every time you sign in to your RentMe Money account.<p></p>
    For example, your RentMe account is linked to both your phone number and your mobile device to make sure only you can access your account.
    If you see unexpected activity or suspect your account was compromised, please let us know.<p></p>
    There are 2 ways to get verification codes: <br>
    1. Through text messages from RentMe. <br>
    2. Download a security app like Duo, Authy, or Google Authenticator to generate the codes.
